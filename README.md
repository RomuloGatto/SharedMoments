## 💪 Motivation

I initially sought a website where my girlfriend and I could document our shared moments and milestones. However, when I couldn't find anything that met our needs, I decided to take matters into my own hands. With the assistance of ChatGPT, I began programming such a website myself.

Initially, I had no plans of making it public, but as the website evolved, gaining more features and exceeding my expectations, I decided to redevelop everything to make it accessible to others: SharedMoments was born.
